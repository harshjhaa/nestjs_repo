In this project I've deep dived into the fundamentals of creating relationships between tables in an application which uses TypeORM.
We'll review a target schema which we'll represent in code.
We're going to cover all the typical table relationships you might have, like One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many 
Also the things like how to configure ON DELETE behavior, working with foreign keys, etc. 
Then we'll discuss the different ways to query records with their related data!
